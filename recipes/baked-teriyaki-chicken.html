    <h2>Description</h2>
    <br />

    <p>
      Teriyaki chicken is simply chicken that is coated in teriyaki sauce. The
      dish comes from the Japanese cooking technique called teriyaki, where meat
      is grilled or broiled with a soy sauce, mirin, and sugar glaze. Today,
      teriyaki chicken refers to any chicken with teriyaki sauce — regardless of
      the cooking method. This teriyaki chicken recipe uses a homemade teriyaki
      sauce to glaze chicken thighs that are baked in the oven for the most
      delicious sticky chicken. This is a much-requested recipe in our house!
      Easy to double for a large group.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <br />

    <ul>
      <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
      <li>½ cup soy sauce</li>
      <li>¼ cup cider vinegar</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon cold water</li>
      <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon ground ginger</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
      <li>12 boneless, skinless chicken thighs</li>
    </ul>

    <br />

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <br />

    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Lightly grease a
        9x13-inch baking dish.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine sugar, soy sauce, cider vinegar, cornstarch, cold water, garlic,
        ginger, and pepper in a small saucepan over low heat. Simmer, stirring
        frequently, until teriyaki sauce thickens and bubbles, 3 to 5 minutes.
        Remove from the heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place chicken thighs in the prepared baking dish. Brush both sides of
        each thigh with the sauce. Reserve any extra sauce for basting.
      </li>
      <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes.</li>
      <li>
        Flip chicken and brush with sauce. Continue to bake, basting with
        remaining sauce every 10 minutes, until no longer pink and juices run
        clear, 20 to 30 more minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
